    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    The problem to solve was that of using a data structure to solve a specific task at hand: read from a file, sort the input, and be able to search an aspect of the data and return the associated information.
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. I started by thinking of the requirements. Storing the data to be used by the program (the data read from file), could have been accomplished multiple ways, but a key requirement of the application was to display the data in a sorted manner. Knowing data structures in this case is advantageous because a binary search tree has kind if "built in" way to access the data in a sorted way.
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    Through rigorous re-testing i was able to overcome multiple issues I had with reading from the file and not getting the data stored and read correctly.
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    This project has helped tremendously because of the pseudocode portion. By having an outline of how to accomplish each subtask leading to the larger task, I was able to visualize and put into code each part, leading to the finished product.
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    This project helped me write better code because I really got into the habit of commenting each section order to reference back what i had done and why, then during my retesting, I would adjust the commenting. Keeping these comments around will help me (and anybody else reading) on what I did and why.
